[LX Studio](http://lx.studio/) is a digital lighting workstation, bringing concepts from digital audio workstations and modular synthesis into the realm of LED lighting control. Generative patterns, interactive inputs, and flexible parameter-driven modulation — a rich environment for lighting composition and performance.

### Getting Started ###

LX Studio uses the [Processing](https://processing.org/download/) framework. There are two ways of working with LX Studio.

* [LXStudio-IDE](https://github.com/heronarts/LXStudio-IDE) &mdash; Work in a complete Java IDE *(recommended!)*
* [LXStudio-P3](https://github.com/heronarts/LXStudio-P3) &mdash; Work in the Processing applet IDE

Consult the [LX Studio API reference &rarr;](http://lx.studio/api/)

### Contact and Collaboration ###

Building a big cool project? I'm probably interested in hearing about it! Want to solicit some help, request new framework features, or just ask a random question? Open an issue on the project or drop me a line: mark@heronarts.com

END OF LIFECYCLE NOTICE

LX Studio has been superceded by the [Chromatik](https://chromatik.co/) Digital Lighting Workstation, which uses the same underlying [LX](https://github.com/heronarts/LX) libraries with a new, modern UI layer. [Chromatik](https://chromatik.co/) continues in the tradition of LX Studio as an open and extensible framework for custom development. It is available for macOS, Windows, and Linux. More information can be found on the website.

![LX Studio](https://raw.github.com/heronarts/LXStudio/master/assets/screenshot.jpg)

[LX Studio](http://lx.studio/) is a digital lighting workstation, bringing concepts from digital audio workstations and modular synthesis into the realm of LED lighting control. Generative patterns, interactive inputs, and flexible parameter-driven modulation â€” a rich environment for lighting composition and performance.

### Getting Started ###

LX Studio uses the [Processing](https://processing.org/download/) framework. There are two ways of working with LX Studio.

* [LXStudio-IDE](https://github.com/heronarts/LXStudio-IDE) &mdash; Work in a complete Java IDE *(recommended!)*
* [LXStudio-P4](https://github.com/heronarts/LXStudio-P4) &mdash; Work in the Processing applet IDE

Documentation is available on the [LX Studio Wiki &rarr;](https://github.com/heronarts/LXStudio/wiki)

Consult the [LX Studio API reference &rarr;](http://lx.studio/api/)

### Contact and Collaboration ###

Building a big cool project? I'm probably interested in hearing about it! Want to solicit some help, request new framework features, or just ask a random question? Open an issue on the project or drop me a line: mark@heronarts.com

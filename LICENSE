1.3. "Revenue Limit" means the gross revenue accrued by Licensee in connection 
with all Licensee Applications, taken together, for any 12-month period during 
the term of this Agreement, with no deductions.

Updates supplied by Heron Arts under this Agreement.

1.5. "Update" means any correction, update, upgrade, patch or other

2.1. Grant. Subject to the limitations of this Section 2, Heron Arts hereby 
grants to Licensee a nonexclusive, worldwide, non-transferable, 
non-sublicenseable license, during the term of this Agreement: (i) to modify 
the Software to create Applications that add substantial value to the Software; 
(ii) to distribute copies of the Software, in object code form only, only as 
part of Applications in accordance with this Section 2; (iii) to use the 
Software to run Applications, including to provide a service consisting of

solely as necessary to exercise the rights granted in clauses (i) through (iv). 
Licensee may not sublicense any of these rights or licenses to any third party. 
Licensee shall not provide any third party with access to the source code for 
the Software without Heron Arts' prior written permission.

The license granted in this Section 2.1 is subject to a Revenue Limit of 
$25,000 and is only valid for Applications that fall within such Revenue Limit. 
The license granted herein is royalty free, in consideration of the Revenue 
Limit being a condition of the license granted herein.

2.2. End User Licensing. If the Application is distributed, provided or sold 
pursuant to an agreement between Licensee and an end user, Licensee shall 
distribute each copy of the Software with an end user license agreement on the 
same licensing terms applicable to the remainder of the Application, but that 
is at least as favorable to Heron Arts as this Agreement.

2.3. Proprietary Notices. On each Software copy, Licensee shall reproduce all 
copyright or other proprietary notices contained on the Software, as provided 
by Heron Arts. Licensee shall not alter or remove or in any other way obscure 
or hide from display any Heron Arts or LX Studio logo or proprietary notice 
from the Application user interface or in the Software.

2.4. Third Party Open Source Software. Notwithstanding Section 2.1, Licensee 
acknowledges that certain components of the Software may be covered by 
so-called "open source" software licenses ("Open Source Components"), which 
means any software licenses approved as open source licenses by the Open Source 
Initiative or any substantially similar licenses. To the extent required by the 
licenses covering Open Source Components, the terms of such licenses will apply 
to such Open Source Components in lieu of the terms of this Agreement. To the 
extent the terms of the licenses applicable to Open Source Components prohibit 
any of the restrictions in this Agreement with respect to such Open Source 
Component, such restrictions will not apply to such Open Source Component. To 
the extent the terms of the licenses applicable to Open Source Components 
require Licensor to make an offer to provide source code or related information 
in connection with the Open Source Components, such offer is hereby made.

3. Ownership. As between the parties, Heron Arts will retain all right, title, 
and interest in the Software, and all intellectual property rights therein.

(collectively, the "Heron Arts Trademarks"). Any and all good will arising from
Licensee's use of the Heron Arts Trademarks will inure solely to the benefit of
Heron Arts. Licensee shall not assert any claim to the Heron Arts Trademarks
(or any confusingly similar mark) or such good will. Licensee shall not
register any Heron Arts Trademark, or any mark confusingly similar to any Heron
Arts Trademark, in any jurisdiction.

5. Heron Arts Portfolio. (i) Licensee hereby grants to Heron Arts the right to
publicize Licensee's use of the Software and (ii) Heron Arts may use Licensee's
logo on the LX Studio website in areas naming licensees of the software, and in
LX Studio portfolios or marketing presentations listing licensees of the

obligations hereunder this Agreement and the licenses granted herein will

automatically terminate, (i) upon the institution by Licensee of insolvency, 
receivership or bankruptcy proceedings or any other proceedings for the 
settlement of its debts, (ii) upon the institution of such proceedings against 
Licensee, which are not dismissed or otherwise resolved in its favor within 60 
days thereafter, (iii) upon Licensee making a general assignment for the 
benefit of creditors, or (iv) upon Licensee's dissolution or ceasing to conduct
